## How it Works 💡
1. **Select your country and city** or let the app use your **geolocation** to fetch the weather details.
2. Based on the weather, **receive activity recommendations** (like a good day for a walk 🚶‍♂️ or a cozy indoor day 🛋️).
3. Create and **categorize your tasks** (Work, Personal, Leisure) to stay on top of your schedule.
4. Use the **task filtering** feature to organize tasks by category!
5. All tasks are **saved locally** so they stay with you even after a page refresh. 💾
